# Data / Access Wishlist — human reviews weekly

- **Historical options prices** (EOD chains + marks, ~2016→present) to backtest
  the options leg honestly. Without it, only the equity/ETF logic can be
  validated — and the options leg is the suspected main performance drag.
  Candidates: ORATS, CBOE DataShop, historicaloptiondata.com.

- **[APPROVED BY HUMAN 2026-07-03 — queued as next [REPAIR], see open_questions #7]**
  **Persist the max-drawdown high-water mark** (`state.equityPeak`,
  server/bot.ts:359/862/2482): in-memory only today, so every
  deploy/restart re-bases the drawdown kill switch from current equity —
  frequent autonomous deploys silently defang it. Proposal: save/restore
  equityPeak via the existing /data/voltrade state files. Touches frozen
  kill-switch machinery -> needs explicit human approval (this entry).
  Evidence: /api/health shows equityPeak 0 after today's deploys.
- **Read-only diagnostics access for autonomous sessions**: all diagnostic
  routes are owner-cookie gated (auth.ts — frozen). Options for human:
  (a) paste /api/bot/audit + /api/bot/ml-status JSON into sessions when
  diagnosis is needed, (b) approve a scoped read-only token path in
  auth.ts, or (c) a nightly job that snapshots key state JSON into the
  repo. Until then KNOWN BROKEN #3/#4 can only be verified by the human.

- **[APPROVED BY HUMAN 2026-07-03 — applied same message]** Constitutional
  amendments A1-A3 + STARVED metric (PROMPTS.md Section A): SPINOUT-READY
  DATA LAYER, RAW-DATA vs SIGNALS surface rules, [PRODUCT] session tag,
  starvation signal in HEALTH OF THE LOOP. Proposal and approval recorded
  here per the amendment rule; applied in the same PR.
- **aisstream.io API key** (for the /data map's live vessel overlay — A4
  build): free signup at aisstream.io -> set the key in Railway as
  AISSTREAM_KEY. The vessels layer ships scaffolded and activates when the
  key exists. HUMAN ACTION NEEDED.

- **[APPROVED BY HUMAN 2026-07-03 — applied same message]** Constitutional
  amendment: PROMOTION RULES gain rule 6 (visual verification) — client/
  PRs must run the DESIGN.md harness at 390/768/1440 and self-review
  screenshots before opening. DESIGN.md + scripts/visual_check.mjs are the
  standard and its enforcement. Proposal+approval recorded here per the
  amendment rule.
